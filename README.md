# ReviewBot - GPT-2 Text Generator for Reviews

**ReviewBot** is a text generation model built using OpenAI's GPT-2, fine-tuned on a custom dataset of reviews (e.g., movie or book reviews). The model is capable of generating reviews based on a given prompt by leveraging the power of GPT-2's transformer architecture.

## Features

- Fine-tunes GPT-2 on a custom dataset.
- Generates text based on a given prompt (e.g., generating movie or book reviews).
- Provides training scripts for fine-tuning GPT-2 on new data.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable, or download the notebook and save it to your Google Drive/Colab).

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install transformers torch
    ```

3. **Upload or load your dataset** in the `.txt` format containing the text (e.g., reviews, movie summaries, or any other text data you want the model to learn from).

## Usage

### Step 1: Load and Preprocess the Data
Load your dataset, preprocess it by removing special characters, and make it ready for training.

### Step 2: Tokenize the Data
The text is tokenized using **GPT-2 tokenizer** and padded to a consistent length.

### Step 3: Fine-tune the GPT-2 Model
Using Hugging Face's `transformers` library, the GPT-2 model is fine-tuned with your data.

### Step 4: Generate Text
After training, you can use the model to generate text based on a user-defined prompt.

### Example Usage

```python
prompt = "The Da Vinci Code is"
generated_text = generate_text(prompt, model, tokenizer)
print("Generated Text:", generated_text)
